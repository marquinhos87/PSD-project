\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this document, we presented the development of a prototype platform for negotiation between large-scale product manufacturers and importers.
The objectives and requirements of the assignment to which this report pertains were first identified, and the design of the developed system was then detailed along with several aspects of its implementation.

A production system should address several more issues, such as persistence of state and replication of services besides the already implemented support for several arbiters, which targets load-balancing.
We leave these matters as future work.
